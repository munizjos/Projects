Howdy! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Dominican University and a third-year student at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). I am pursuing a bachelorâ€™s of science in both mathematics and mechanical engineering through the help of a joint program with IIT. I enjoy playing Minecraft, baking desserts, and working out in my spare time. I also enjoy going on road trips during the summer and exploring new places around me.

In the future, I aspire to work in the automotive industry. However, I am open-minded to exploring other fields that will bring me passion. I look forward to seeing what the future holds for me.
